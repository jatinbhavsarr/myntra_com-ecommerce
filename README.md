# **Myntra: Sales, Stock, and Demographic Analysis Dashboard**

## **Executive Summary**  
The Myntra project involves creating a comprehensive Power BI dashboard to analyze and visualize sales, stock levels, and customer demographics for June, July, and August of 2019. The dashboard integrates data from sales performance, stock availability, product categories (brand, material, size, gender), and customer demographics to offer actionable insights that drive marketing strategies and improve inventory management.

## **Business Problem**  
Myntra faced challenges in understanding sales trends, inventory levels, and customer preferences across various categories such as brand, material, size, gender, and demographics during June, July, and August 2019. There was a lack of visibility into which products and customer segments were driving sales, leading to missed marketing opportunities, overstocking, and inefficient inventory management.

## **Objective**  
The primary objective of this project was to build an interactive Power BI dashboard that:
- Analyzes sales trends, stock levels, and product performance across different categories (brand, material, size, gender).
- Identifies customer segments based on demographics and purchasing behavior.
- Provides marketing recommendations and insights to optimize product offerings and promotions.
- Optimizes inventory levels to ensure better stock management and demand forecasting.

## **Tools I Use**  
- **Power BI**: For creating interactive visualizations and performance dashboards.  
- **Power Query**: For cleaning, transforming, and integrating sales and demographic data from multiple sources.  
- **DAX**: For advanced data analysis, calculations, and key performance metrics.

## **Suggestions**  
- Collaborate closely with suppliers to ensure faster replenishment of popular brands like **Anouk** and **Biba**, minimizing stockouts and improving sales opportunities.
- Capitalize on the popularity of **Anouk** and **Biba** by creating product bundles, offering customers more value while increasing **Average Order Value (AOV)**.
- **Straight Kurta** and **A-Line Kurta** are best-sellers and should be prominently featured in upcoming marketing campaigns to attract more customers and drive higher sales.
- Implement a notification system to alert customers when out-of-stock items become available again, enhancing customer satisfaction and loyalty.
- Allocate higher stock levels for high-demand colors, such as **blue** and **black**, to reduce the likelihood of stockouts and meet customer preferences.

## **Challenges**  
A key challenge was integrating and cleaning data from various sources, including sales performance, inventory levels, and customer demographics, to ensure the dashboard provided accurate and consistent insights. Managing large datasets with varied product categories and demographic information required careful data transformation and optimization in Power Query to maintain dashboard performance.

## **Learnings**  
- Gained expertise in using **DAX** to perform complex calculations related to sales performance, inventory forecasting, and customer segmentation.
- Enhanced skills in **Power Query** for transforming and cleaning large datasets from multiple data sources.
- Developed the ability to identify key trends in product sales, stock levels, and customer demographics to inform marketing decisions.
- Learned how to optimize **Power BI dashboards** for large datasets, ensuring they provide real-time insights for business decisions.
- Gained insights into **inventory management strategies** and **marketing effectiveness** based on customer behavior and product performance.
